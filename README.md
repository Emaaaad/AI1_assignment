# Windy Grid World with Q-Learning

## Project Overview
This project implements a Q-learning agent to solve the Windy Grid World problem, a classical reinforcement learning challenge. The agent learns to navigate through a grid influenced by wind, aiming to reach a goal location in the minimum number of steps. The project demonstrates key concepts of reinforcement learning and Q-learning algorithm, and provides insightful visualizations of the policy and value functions.

## Features
- **Windy Grid World Environment**: Customizable grid environment with variable wind forces.
- **Q-Learning Algorithm**: Implementation of the Q-learning algorithm for policy learning.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Includes a Q-values heatmap and a policy table with color-coded squares and arrows for a clear understanding of the learned policy.
